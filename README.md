## Description
This software helps potential developers consider the many options in programming and choose an Epicodus study track. It presents a series of questions regarding their interests and calculates a value based on user response. The backend algorithm calculates their score based on these values and the frontend makes a suggestion to the user, complete with a short explanation.

## Setup/Installation Requirements


* Clone the repository using $git clone https://github.com/bkiggen/trackChoose
* _Open index.html in a web browser_

## Notes

*9:00 Struggling with getting my divs to, on click, toggle radio button states AND be links to next question. Can't get label to sit inside div - trying to overflow on me.

* 10:30 Looked up click-scroll function on stackoverflow. Knew what I needed, didn't know how to execute, understand code I'm using.

* Can't get 'required' to work on radio buttons. I am going to use js if statements, knowing there must be a more elegant solution.
